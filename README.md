# Ray Tracer Challenge

This project is a simple [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) implementation of the ray tracer described in
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).

You can find an interactive demo of this ray tracer online at [sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge](https://sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge).

## Performance profiling

Although the ray tracer is not (yet) multithreaded and the small vector math library it uses does not (yet) leverage Zig's
SIMD builtins, it is still very fast. Running on a single thread, this ray tracer has outperformed every other Ray Tracer
Challenge implementation (even the multithreaded ones!) I've compared it withâ€”except
[https://iliathoughts.com/posts/raytracer2/](https://iliathoughts.com/posts/raytracer2/) (for now). And there is still
significant room for optimization.

The optimizations I do make are largely informed by profilers. When built for native, the binary can be profiled with
`valgrind --tool=callgrind` and the results inspected with `qcachegrind`, which works well enough. Unfortunately,
[Valgrind's troubled state on macOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13n3tjt/i_find_its_not_possible_to_do_serious_cc_coding/),
combined with [Zig's incomplete Valgrind support](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1837), means profiling is not
always simple. For example, I've seen Valgrind erroneously run into `SIGILL` and the like. Using `std.heap.raw_c_allocator`
seems to fix most of these issues.

The ray tracer currently runs about 2x slower on WebAssembly than on native, which is reasonable. I use Firefox's
"performance" tab in the developer tools for profiling on the web.

I also use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) for benchmarking.
