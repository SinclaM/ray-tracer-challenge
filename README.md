# Ray Tracer Challenge

This project is a simple [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) implementation of the ray tracer described in
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).

You can find an interactive demo of this ray tracer online at [sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge](https://sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge).

## Performance profiling

Although the ray tracer is not (yet) heavily optimized (e.g. is does not yet leverage Zig's SIMD builtins),
it is still very fastâ€”faster in fact on a single thread than almost every other Ray Tracer Challenge implementation
on multiple threads I've compared with. And there is still significant room for optimization.

The optimizations I do make are largely informed by profilers. When built for native, the binary can be profiled with
`valgrind --tool=callgrind` and the results inspected with `qcachegrind`, which works well enough. Unfortunately,
[Valgrind's troubled state on macOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13n3tjt/i_find_its_not_possible_to_do_serious_cc_coding/),
combined with [Zig's incomplete Valgrind support](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1837), means profiling is not
always simple. For example, I've seen Valgrind erroneously run into `SIGILL` and the like. Using `std.heap.raw_c_allocator`
seems to fix most of these issues.

The ray tracer currently runs about 2x slower on WebAssembly than on native, which is reasonable. I use Firefox's
"performance" tab in the developer tools for profiling on the web.

I also use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) for benchmarking.
