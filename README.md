# Ray Tracer Challenge

This project is a simple [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) implementation of the ray tracer described in
[The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).

You can find an interactive demo of this ray tracer online at [sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge](https://sinclam.github.io/ray-tracer-challenge).

## Performance profiling

Although the ray tracer is not (yet) heavily optimized (e.g. it does not yet leverage Zig's SIMD builtins),
it is still very fast‚Äîfaster in fact on a single thread than almost every other Ray Tracer Challenge implementation
on multiple threads I've compared with. And there is still significant room for optimization.

The optimizations I do make are largely informed by profilers. When built for native, the binary can be profiled with
`valgrind --tool=callgrind` and the results inspected with `qcachegrind`, which works well enough. Unfortunately,
[Valgrind's troubled state on macOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/13n3tjt/i_find_its_not_possible_to_do_serious_cc_coding/),
combined with [Zig's incomplete Valgrind support](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/1837), means profiling is not
always simple. For example, I've seen Valgrind erroneously run into `SIGILL` and the like. Using `std.heap.raw_c_allocator`
on native seems to fix most of these issues.

The ray tracer currently runs about 2x slower on WebAssembly than on native, which is reasonable. I use Firefox's
"performance" tab in the developer tools for profiling on the web.

I also use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) for benchmarking.

Performance on the website for complicated scenes can be seriously inhibited by memory consumption, since each web worker
maintains its own complete copy of the scene information. It would be easy to simple share memory, using a `SharedArrayBuffer`
for the WASM memory, but unfortunately Zig currently provides no support (or documentation) for this. 

## Benchmarks

Below are some benchmarks for scenes that can be found on the website. These benchmarks are not rigorously controlled
and averaged, but rather a general overview of speeds for various scenes. The best way to get a feel for the performance
is to try things out yourself!

All benchmarks were done on a 2019 MacBook Pro (2.6Ghz, 6-Core Intel i7; 16GB RAM; macOS 12.6.7). WASM specific benchmarks
were done on Firefox 117 using 6 web workers (the maximum number of web workers Firefox will run in parallel, even on my
12 logical CPU system ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Native runs used 12 threads.

The 'WASM Preheated' category refers to renders done with the scene pre-built (scene description already parsed, objects
and bounding boxes already made, textures already loaded, etc.), which is supported on the site through the arrow key
camera movememnt. This preheating is irrelevant for simple scenes, but gives massive speedups for scenes that load
textures or construct BVHs.

## Other implementations
There are many great implementations of the Ray Tracer Challenge. At many points throughout the project, I referred to others
to verify my implementation, draw inspiration, or compare performance. I recommend you check out the following ray tracers:

* [graytracer](https://github.com/JarrodBegnoche/graytracer): fully-implemented, easy to setup, performant.
* [The Raytracer Challenge REPL](https://raytracer.xyz/): online demo with amazing site design.
* [RayTracerCPU](https://iliathoughts.com/posts/raytracer2/): very fast, helpful online demo.

[^1]: The skybox for this scene is a hefty 240 MB, so the rendering time on the website is dominated by the time needed to download the skybox texture from the server.
